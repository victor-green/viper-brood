# Viper Brood
An Application Template for Data Science in Python

Goal: To create a universal template for data science workflow as it

pertains to python. The purpose is to predifine as much boilerplate code

as possible subscribing to a functional programming paridigm allowing aspiring

and current data scientists to focus on data science while learning the particulars

of the python programming language. Use and modify this template as you see fit and

please fork this project on github. All improvements / suggestions are wellcome.

Many Thanks, Victor Green Data Engineer / Data Scientist
